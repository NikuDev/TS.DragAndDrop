# TS.DragAndDrop
A practice project utilizing the functions of pure TypeScript to create a simple drag and drop project overview.

It is possible to use the form in the top to add Projects to the 'Active' list. After this, a project can be
dragged and dropped into the 'Finished' list (moving it back to the 'Active' list is possible).

## Using:
- html templates
- abstract classes
- generic types
- interfaces
- events and eventListeners
